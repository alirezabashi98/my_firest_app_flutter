# flutter_app

<a href="#">README fa</a>

The first step is to run the code inside the mine class in the run-up method as shown below

``main.dart``
```dart
import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {

  runApp(
    Text("Hello Flutter!",textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,)
  );

}
```

The following class must be imported


```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

Inside the Run app method, we defined a text that displays a text
And two text attributes, one string with a hi-flutter value and one left-right definition of the text

```dart
void main() {

  runApp(
    Text("Hello Flutter!",textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,)
  );

}
```
